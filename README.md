          Project: this project is that create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users are  able to visit the web application through their browser, submit an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. 
 
 
 ## what is tensorflow 
  
  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=zh-cn)is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.It is used for both research and production at Google,min 0:15/2:17 [4]:p.2 [3]:0:26/2:17 often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.
  TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on November 9, 2015
  
  ## The resource 
  
  [Tensorflow-mnist example](https://github.com/sugyan/tensorflow-mnist)
  
  [Tensorflow start](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  
  [Identify the image](http://blog.csdn.net/wlmnzf/article/details/51040158)
  
  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
  
  ## How to use that
  
  1. setting environment
        install python
        pip3 install tensorflow (if using the pip, the tensorflow could be intalled in python2.7 library)
        pip3 install opencv-python(using cv2 scan the number photo) 
        pip3 install numpy
  
 
  2.open website on the browser
       
        git clone SSH or Download the ZIP

        FLASK_APP=webapp.py flask run
  
  
  ## running result
  
  this project owns three python file, learning.py is that machine learn how to discern number from image
  
  type python3 Learning.py
